# Car Detection
Car detection is a computer vision technology that involves the automatic identification of cars in images or videos. It has a wide range of applications, including traffic monitoring, parking lot management, and autonomous driving.

In recent years, car detection algorithms have improved significantly, thanks to the availability of large datasets and advances in deep learning techniques. These algorithms typically operate by processing the image or video feed through a deep neural network that has been trained to identify cars based on a set of features, such as shape, color, and texture.

# Model Architecture:
The model architecture used in this project consists of a pre-trained YOLO v8 (You Only Look Once) model that is used as the object detection framework. YOLO is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that can detect objects in real-time with high accuracy.

The YOLO model consists of a series of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. The convolutional layers extract features from the input image, while the fully connected layers classify the object and predict its bounding box coordinates.

For car detection, the YOLO model is trained on a large dataset of images and videos that contain cars. The model learns to identify the unique features of cars, such as their shape, color, and texture, and uses this information to detect cars in new images or videos.

The final output of this architecture is a set of bounding boxes that indicate the location of the detected cars in the image or video feed, along with a confidence score that indicates how certain the model is that each bounding box contains a car.
